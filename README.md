# Awesome Docker

A comprehensive collection of production-ready Docker containers and solutions for common development and deployment scenarios.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository contains a curated set of Docker-based solutions that solve real-world problems developers face daily. Each solution is self-contained, well-documented, and ready for immediate use in development, testing, and production environments.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each task is implemented as its own subfolder with complete documentation and Docker configurations:

- **Ephemeral Multi-Database Playground** - Temporary, self-destructing database environments
- **Browserless Debugging Sandbox with AI** - Headless browser debugging with AI assistance
- **Single-Image Time-Series DB + Grafana** - All-in-one monitoring solution
- **API Anywhere Converter** - Auto-generate APIs from databases and CSV files
- **ML Model Stress Tester** - Benchmark and test ML models
- **Distributed Cron Job Simulator** - Local simulation of distributed cron systems

## 🚀 Quick Start

Each solution can be used independently. Navigate to any subfolder and follow the README instructions:

```bash
# Example: Start the ephemeral database playground
cd ephemeral-multi-db-playground
docker compose up -d
```
